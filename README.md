# Mobile-Logic-Circuit-Recognition-and-Verilog-Code-Generation
LogiCam is a mobile-based system that scans digital logic circuits using a phone camera, detects logic gates with a YOLOv8n-TFLite model, reconstructs the Boolean expression, and generates Verilog codeâ€”enabling real-time, offline circuit analysis directly on Android devices.
